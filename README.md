This is a repository for the Halifax PLAYS organizers manual.

Halifax PLAYS (Halifax Players' League for Affordable Yearly Sports) Association is a ratified Non-Profit Society under the Nova Scotia Registry of Joint Stocks based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Our sport leagues are organized and operated by a committed set of volunteers in order to minimize playing costs. In addition to financial accessibility, we also foster accessibility in a broader sense by welcoming players of all backgrounds, genders and skill levels to our leagues. 

In order to ensure that Halifax PLAYS remains sustainable for years to come, an organizers manual must be created to ensure the lessons we have learned can be passed down to future PLAYS members. We are at a point in the expansion of PLAYS where many of the leagues are operating with their own set of practices, which is problematic. Developing a comprehensive set of "best practices" will help us consider the weaknesses within our organization and help us start a dialogue between leagues. Additionally, establishing best practices will help our Treasurer out and make the job slightly simpler! 

A few points:
  -The manual must be written in as accessible a style as possible- bullet points are preferred over wordy sentences! 
  -The manual must also be visually appealing, as screenshots can be very helpful in conveying the points.
  -Anyone is allowed to offer edits to the manual, but only a Board Member can commit.
  
We also hope to start a conversation with other non-profit sports organizations around the world. We hope to improve by learning about the best practices recommended by these organizations and offer our own ideas about how to ensure accessible, sustainable and fun sports leagues.
